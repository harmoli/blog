Welcome to my technical blog.  Over the years, I've amassed more notes in my
Moleskines than are ever truly comprehendible a month, let alone a year
later.  At the encouragement of a few friends and former classmates, I am
starting a blog in hopes to organize a bit of what I've learned whilst
coding, in whatever shape or form it may be.  

Whether you have stumbled upon this blog by random chance or are looking for
some more information in relation to some of the projects I have done, I hope
that something here will help you.  If you are here because of the latter
reason, feel free to reach out to me if any of what I have written does not make
sense, or if there are additional comments or corrections you may have.
Happy browsing!
